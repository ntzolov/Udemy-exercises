          <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Tantra</h2>
          <p>Tantra is a range of esoteric traditions which had begun to arise in India by the 5th century CE.[203][note
            19] Its use suggests that the word tantra in the Rigveda means "technique". George Samuel wrote that tantra
            is a contested term, but may be considered a school whose practices appeared in nearly-complete form in
            Buddhist and Hindu texts by about the 10th century CE.[205] Tantric yoga developed complex visualizations,
            which included meditation on the body as a microcosm of the cosmos. It included mantras, breath control, and
            body manipulation (including its nadis and chakras. Teachings about chakras and Kundalini became central to
            later forms of Indian yoga.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-tertiary">Medieval hatha yoga</h2>
          <p>The first references to hatha yoga are in eighth-century Buddhist works.[221] The earliest definition of
            hatha yoga is in the 11th-century Buddhist text Vimalaprabha.[222] Hatha yoga blends elements of Patanjali's
            Yoga Sutras with posture and breathing exercises.[223] It marks the development of asanas into the full-body
            postures in current popular use[208] and, with its modern variations, is the style presently associated with
            the word "yoga".</p>
